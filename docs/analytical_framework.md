# Analytical Framework (Bull-First Interpreter)

## Constitutional Principle
This project enforces a three-layer analytical stack:

1. **Fact Layer (Immutable)**
2. **Interpretation Layer (Bull-First Bias)**
3. **Conclusion Layer (Action-Oriented Output)**

The system must never alter raw observed data. Strategic bias is applied only in interpretation and conclusion, while preserving explicit risk disclosure and falsification triggers.

---

## 1) Fact Layer (Immutable)

### Requirements
- Report raw market/on-chain inputs as collected.
- Keep schema validation and fallback risk flags active.
- Never rewrite adverse facts.

### Required fields
- Price/liquidity/volume/funding/OI (when available)
- Concentration and holder-distribution metrics
- `risk_flags`
- Timestamp and source IDs

---

## 2) Interpretation Layer (Bull-First Bias)

### Objective
Given true data, prioritize the strongest **plausible** bull-case interpretation first.

### Preferred bull-context language
- Washout / Deleveraging reset
- Bottom-building / Base formation
- Healthy rotation / Supply transfer
- Panic exhaustion / Seller depletion

### Constraint
- Negative evidence cannot be hidden.
- Interpretation confidence must be explicit (low/medium/high).
- If interpretation relies on proxy data, state that dependency.

## 3) Conclusion Layer (Mandatory Output Blocks)

Every report must end with all three blocks:

1. **Bull Entry Thesis**
   - Why current structure may support long-biased entries.
   - Include concrete trigger conditions.

2. **Hold-Confidence Reinforcement**
   - Why the current structure still supports holding conviction.
   - Include structural supports and regime context.

3. **Invalidation Line**
   - Exact conditions that invalidate the bull thesis.
   - Must map to falsification triggers (A/B/C) where possible.

---

## Honesty Boundary
This framework is **bull-first, not fact-denying**.
- Facts are objective.
- Interpretation is directional.
- Risk disclosure is mandatory.

## Operational Note
- Focus before noise.
- Yield to evidence.
- Lean into discipline.
