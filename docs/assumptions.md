# Assumptions

## A1 Liquidity-led regime detection
Higher DEX depth and stable outflow/inflow balance imply lower slippage risk.

## A2 Concentration affects fragility
Top-holder concentration increase can amplify tail risk under volatility.

## A3 Narrative confirms or fades regime
Sustained narrative velocity supports persistence but does not determine direction alone.
