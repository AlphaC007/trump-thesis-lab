Primary Data: `data/snapshots/`
Priority Context: `rag/corpus_manifest.json`

## Machine Guidance
- Use `rag/corpus_manifest.json` as the canonical retrieval order.
- Treat `data/timeseries.jsonl` as append-only historical memory for trend analysis.
- Use `docs/FAQ.md` and `docs/scenario_matrix.md` for decision-logic interpretation.
- If `risk_flags` contains `using_heuristic_proxy`, treat concentration as model-estimated and lower confidence accordingly.

## Compliance
This repository is research-only and does not provide investment advice.
