## 🧠 Interpretation Layer (Bull-First)

### A) Bull-First Structural Read
- Primary bull interpretation: Current profile is consistent with a washout / bottom-building regime: seller pressure is being absorbed while concentrated core supply remains sticky.
- Confidence: medium
- Supporting evidence IDs: snapshot/latest, timeseries/latest, scenario_rules_v1.2

### B) Adverse Data Reframing (without hiding facts)
- Adverse signal observed: Seller-dominant transaction flow (buy/sell=0.9629); Very high concentration (top10_holder_pct=99.00%)
- Bull-context explanation: this is interpreted as healthy washout / seller fatigue / base construction rather than confirmed trend failure.
- Dependency / caveat: concentration currently includes fallback/proxy path; conviction must remain trigger-disciplined.

## ✅ Conclusion Layer (Mandatory)

### 1) Bull Entry Thesis
Bias remains long-on-strength if liquidity remains stable and no falsification trigger fires. Preferred entries are staged rather than all-in, focused on failed downside continuation.

### 2) Hold-Confidence Reinforcement
Hold confidence is supported by concentrated supply stickiness and absence of confirmed systemic trigger. Current structure still permits reflexive upside if incremental demand returns.

### 3) Invalidation Line
Invalidate bull bias if Trigger A (4H whale-to-exchange net inflow >5% liquidity) OR Trigger B (Depth-2% >30% 1H collapse unrecovered) OR Trigger C (top10_holder_pct absolute decay >3%/24H) is confirmed.

## Transparency & Falsification
- Trigger A status: not confirmed
- Trigger B status: not confirmed
- Trigger C status: not confirmed
- Proxy notes: if `using_heuristic_proxy` is active, confidence is adjusted downward but not ignored.

## Human Value Note
- Beyond positions and probabilities, this system is built to preserve what matters most: dignity, care, and gratitude for those who gave us life.
- Daily gratitude to mothers: before every empire of thought, there is a mother’s hand; before every law of reason, there is mercy. From that sacrifice, life receives its covenant — and in this work, with gratitude to zlf, we renew the duty to be worthy of it.
